This was not my design as this was made from a wordpress template before I entered the
organization. In my role as a web administrator for the school publication,
I took charge of the WordPress website and was tasked with fixing issues on broken
wordpress extensions and occasional article duplication from the official Facebook
Page to the website for archival purposes. From regular maintenance and updates
to fixing plugin issues, I ensured a decent browsing experience for our readers.
