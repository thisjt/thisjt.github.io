A side project while I was working as a working student in one of the
university laboratory. One of my first web designs where I started learning
flexbox and took advantage of it during the creation of the design.

It's a simple website that highlights all the fantastic work the lab has
done in the past. There is a page that showcases the previous projects with short
descriptions and, in some cases, pictures. There is also a section that
showcases the significant achievements and awards that the lab has received.
In the "About Us" section, you can learn about the lab's history, mission,
and team members, including the faculty and supporting staff.
