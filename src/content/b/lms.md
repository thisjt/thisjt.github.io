This is my quick but fun journey of creating a Laundry Management System for one of my clients
trying to find a way to track their laundry earnings. It also provides basic info and an overview
of how the laundry business is currently running, inventory status on whether they need to replenish,
and also provide a way to print receipts for easier tracking and monitoring of individual laundry loads.

The technology stack used for this system is SvelteKit with PWA integration and PostgreSQL (I was orinally
using MySQL on PlanetScale, but I migrated to PostgreSQL on Neon DB as
[PlanetScale is shutting down their free hobby tier.](https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-forever)).

Here are some screenshots of the design and functionality of the system.
