Biomed Pharmacy - IMPOSS is a pharmacy management system. (IMPOSS is abbreviation for
Inventory Management and Point-of-Sales System) It uses NW.js, Node.js, Express, MySQL,
JavaScript, HTML, and Sass technologies to create this project to make pharmacy operations
more efficient and easier. Let's explore the journey of creating this system and the
technologies behind it.

-   NW.js\
    NW.js is a helpful tool that lets us make desktop applications using web technologies. With NW.js,
    we made an application that works well on Windows computers. This made it simple for pharmacists
    to manage inventory, transactions, and reports easily.

-   Empowering the Back-End with Node.js and Express\
    For the back-end, we used Node.js and Express. These tools helped us create a strong server system
    that can handle prolonged usage and stability. This made the system fast and responsive.

-   Storing Data with MySQL\
    Storing and getting information is crucial for any pharmacy. We used MySQL, a reliable database
    system, to do this. It helped us organize data about inventory, stocks, transactions, sales reports,
    and users efficiently.

-   Making User-Friendly Interfaces with JavaScript, HTML, and Sass\
    We designed interfaces that are easy to use and look nice. JavaScript, HTML, and Sass helped us
    create interactive elements and simple but elegant designs.

Creating Biomed Pharmacy's Pharmacy System was an exciting journey. Using NW.js, Node.js,
Express, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and Sass, we built a powerful system that improves inventory
management, transactions, and sales reporting.

This project shows how technology can make a big difference in how pharmacies work. By being
innovative and dedicated, businesses like Biomed Pharmacy can thrive in the fast-changing world
of technology.
